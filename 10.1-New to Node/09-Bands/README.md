# Bands

## File

* *None*

## Instructions

* Make a JavaScript file called `bands.js` that exports an object of music genres and bands like this:

  ```javascript
  {
    punk: 'Green Day',
    rap: 'Run DMC',
    classic: 'Led Zeppelin'
  }
  ```

* Require this JavaScript file in `run.js`, loop over the values, and console.log them.

* **Note**: If you are having trouble with looping through objects, please google `how to loop through objects in javascript` to get yourself in the right direction!

* Utilize a `for/in statement` to loop through the object and call a single `console.log()` that will output all of your bands. Do not write anymore than ONE console.log() within your code (it will go inside for/in loop)

* Make sure the program runs properly when entered into the terminal like this:

  ```bash
  node run.js
  ```

* And that the output looks something like the below:

  ```bash
  A punk band is Green Day
  A rap band is Run DMC
  A classic band is Led Zeppelin
  ```

### Bonuses

* Make it so that your program takes in a parameter like 'classic' and then outputs the associated band with it. In this case Led Zeppelin.

* If no parameter is passed then loop over and output all of them like asked above.
