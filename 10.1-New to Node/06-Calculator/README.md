## Instructions

* Create a command-line node application that takes in parameters like this:

  * `node calculator.js add 1 2` ... and outputs 3
  * `node calculator.js subtract 5 2` ... and outputs 3
  * `node calculator.js multiply 3 2` ... and outputs 6
  * `node calculator.js divide 8 2` ... and outputs 4
  * `node calculator.js remainder 7 2`... and outputs 1

### Bonuses

* Enable your calculator application to also handle the below cases:

  * `node calculator.js exp 7 2` ... and output 49 (7 squared)
  * `node calculator.js algebra 4x+2=10`... and output 2. (Hint: Assume the algebra will always be in this exact form and will always be addition)
