# Parameter Check

## File

* *None*

## Instructions

* Create a command line node application that takes in two parameters and outputs whether they are equal or not.

### Hints

* Start by simply logging the value of each argument to console. Then use your usual JavaScript approach (recall that Node is still just JavaScript).
