# Responsiveness Assignment

### Overview

In this assignment, you'll create two different portfolios. The first will be building
your portfolio layout using the Bootstrap CSS Framework. The second will be enhancing
the portfolio you made last unit with a mobile-responsive layout.

### Before You Begin

* If you opted to do the wireframe (easier) assignment for last homework or if you struggled with the portfolio design, ask a member of the instructional staff to provide you with the solution files. This will provide a starting point for the current assignment. 

* You've learned a ton of material: HTML, CSS, GitHub, GitHub Pages, and Bootstrap. If you feel like you're falling behind, there's no need to panic. You'll have plenty of time to digest and master this material.

* We're diving into JavaScript next unit, and HTML/CSS will start receiving less focus. Still, you'll find that a basic knowledge of HTML/CSS will help you understand JavaScript, especially when we use it to manipulate web pages.

### Commits

Having an active and healthy commit history on GitHub is important for your future job search. It is also extremely important for making sure your work is saved in your repository. If something breaks, committing often ensures you are able to go back to a working version of your code.

* Committing often is a signal to employers that you are actively working on your code and learning.

  * We use the mantra “commit early and often.”  This means that when you write code that works, add it and commit it!

  * Numerous commits allow you to see how your app is progressing and give you a point to revert to if anything goes wrong.

* Be clear and descriptive in your commit messaging.

  * When writing a commit message, avoid vague messages like "fixed." Be descriptive so that you and anyone else looking at your repository knows what happened with each commit.

* We would like you to have well over 200 commits by graduation, so commit early and often!

### Submission on BCS

* Please submit both the deployed Github.io link to your homework AND the link to the Github Repository!

### Instructions

1. Create two new GitHub repositories and name them `Bootstrap-Portfolio` and `Responsive-Portfolio`.

2. Clone these repositories to your computer.

### Assignment One Instructions (Bootstrap)

1. Inside your `Bootstrap-Portfolio` repo, create `index.html`, `portfolio.html` and `contact.html`.

2. Using Bootstrap, recreate your portfolio site with the following items:

   * A navbar

   * A responsive layout (remember the grid, rows and columns are your friends)

     * eg. On an `xs` screen, content should take up the entire screen. On `sm` and larger screens, you should have some margins on the left and right side of the screen. Check out various sites on your mobile device versus your computer to see this in action!

   * Responsive images

   **BONUS**
   Using Bootstrap, make a sticky footer and use sub-rows and sub-columns on your portfolio site _(Hint: Check out the Bootstrap documentation)_

3. Your Bootstrap solution should minimize use of media queries.

4. Deploy your new Bootstrap-powered portfolio to GitHub Pages.

### Assignment Two Instructions - (No Bootstrap)

1. Copy the contents of `Basic-Portfolio` (your first homework solution) and paste the mentioned files into `Responsive-Portfolio`.

2. Note: Be sure not to include any dot files (e.g. .git, .gitignore) from the `Basic-Portfolio` repo.

3. If you chose the `Wireframe` exercise for your first homework assignment, talk to a TA, who will provide you with a template for your portfolio.

4. Inside your `Responsive-Portfolio` folder, find your `styles.css` file. You will write your media queries at the bottom of `styles.css`.

5. Use three `@media screen` tags, each with one of these `max-width`s: `980px`, `768px` and `640px`.

   * You use `980px` because you never want any of the content to be cut off. Since the desktop layout is about 960px wide, you want the media queries to kick in before your content gets cut off.

   * `768px` is about the width of a tablet and `640px` is about the width of a phone in landscape.

6. Make the layout match the following screenshots:

   * `index.html`: [980px](Images/980-index.jpg), [768px](Images/768-index.jpg), [640px](Images/640-index.jpg)

   * `portfolio.html`: [980px](Images/980-portfolio.jpg), [768px](Images/768-portfolio.jpg), [640px](Images/640-portfolio.jpg)

   * `contact.html`: [980px](Images/980-contact.jpg), [768px](Images/768-contact.jpg), [640px](Images/640-contact.jpg)

7. Make the position of the header `static` (the default positioning) when the screen is `640px` wide. The header design takes up a lot of room; you don't want it to stick to the top of a small screen and leave no room for the rest of your site.

8. Be sure to include the `viewport` tag in all your HTML files, otherwise your media-queries won't function as expected on mobile devices. _(Hint: You won't need to use exact pixels for anything other than the container)_

9. **Protip**: Use the Chrome extensions [Window Resizer](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/window-resizer/kkelicaakdanhinjdeammmilcgefonfh) and [Browser Width](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/browser-width/mlnegepkjlccabakompdmbcmdieaideh) to see the browser dimensions in Chrome.

10. Deploy your new portfolio (now with media queries!) to GitHub Pages.

### Submitting Your Work on [BootCampSpot](https://www.bootcampspot-v2.com/)

1. Submit the GitHub links to your portfolio repositories on GitHub.

2. Submit the link to your (GitHub Pages) deployed site in the same input field.

### BONUS

* Incorporate CSS animations in your portfolio. [More info here](http://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_animations.asp).

### Reminder: Submission on BCS

* Please submit both the deployed Github.io link to your homework AND the link to the Github Repository!

### One More Thing

If you have any questions about this project or the material we have covered, please post them in the community channels in slack so that your fellow developers can help you! If you're still having trouble, you can come to office hours for assistance from your instructor and TAs.

**Good Luck!**
