# Activity 5 - GitHub Pages Personal Bio

Now that we have gone over how to create a personal website using GitHub Pages, it is time to publish your own personal website! See the guide below as a reminder of what steps you need to take. 

### Instructions

* Build a basic HTML page and deploy it to github pages.
* Once your personal webpage is live, slack out the link to it so that everyone can see what you have made.

### Guide

1. Create a new repo that is named `<<YOUR USERNAME>>.github.io` where <<YOUR USERNAME>> is your GitHub username. Double check that you use exactly your username. (For example, janedoe.github.io would be the GitHub pages repo name for the GitHub user "janedoe")  
2. Navigate into a folder and clone the repo into it
3. Add an HTML file named `index.html` and code out a basic webpage (or use a previous page)
4. Add, commit, and push your changes into the repository
5. Navigate to `<<YOUR_USERNAME>>.github.io` and you will find that your new web page has gone live! (again, where <<YOUR USERNAME>> is your GitHub username. - we just use that as a placeholder.)

### Bonuses

* Spruce up your personal website page: add extra tags and flesh your page out some more - give it some pop
* Push updates to your personal website multiple times. You'll see it update on the live URL!
* Add a few new pages to your website
* Add CSS to your deployed webpage, including a CSS Reset
