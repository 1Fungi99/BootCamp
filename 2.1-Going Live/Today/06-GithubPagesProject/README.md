# Activity 6 - GitHub Pages Project Webpage

In this activity you'll practice creating github pages with projects. You'll build a website about your favorite type of animal!

### Instructions

Make a simple website about your favorite type of animal.

* Create a header that will act as a title for the page
* Create a few short paragraphs describing the animal's best characteristics. 
* Include at least one picture of the animal

* Once you have created your HTML add, commit, and push your files up to GitHub Pages.
  * Make sure to navigate to your page in the web browser to ensure your website is live

### Guide

1. Create a new repository on your GitHub account. *You can name this repository whatever you would like.*
2. Once inside of the repository, create a new file and name it `index.html`
3. Add your HTML into this file, save it, and then navigate into your repository's `Settings` tab.
4. Scroll down to the GitHub Pages section and then, in the section labeled `Source`, select that you would like to use the `master` branch as your source.
5. Navigate to `<<YOUR USERNAME>>.github.io/<<REPO NAME YOU CHOSE>>` and you will find that your new web page has gone live! (For example, if your GitHub username is `johndoe` and the project is `cssDemo`, your URL would be `johndoe.github.io/cssDemo`) 

### Bonuses

* See if you can use your personal site from the previous activity as a portfolio that can be used to show off all of the work you have done in the past. Update it to link to this activity's site.
* Try to create a navigation system which links from your personal website to this new animal site and vice-versa.
* Have some fun! Test your HTML and CSS skills by going above and beyond with your page!
