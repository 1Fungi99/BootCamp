## Front-End Team

* Begin creating basic click events. Register the submit button

* Create working transfers of data between the text-boxes and the backend.

* Experiment with creating content regions for where the article will go.

## Back-End Team

* Create the AJAX call needed to retrieve data then console.log all of the relevant fields.

* Incorporate various “optional parameters” (hard code these in initially).
