# Weather Dest

## File

* [`weatherdest.js`](weatherdest.js)

## Instructions

* Take a moment to run the `weatherdest.js` application. (Try to figure out what it takes to run on your own!)

* Then, with a partner, spend a few moments answering the following questions:

  * What does the code do?

  * How does it work at a general level?

  * How does it work at a line level?

## NPM Init/Install

* Navigate to the root of your project folder

* Then do the following:

  * Create a `package.json` file (i.e. run `npm init`)

  * Add your dependencies to the `package.json` (i.e. run `npm install <package-name1>` and `npm install <package-name2>`)

  * Confirm that you now have a `node_modules` folder with the `<package-name1>` and `<package-name2>` packages as a result

  * Finally, re-run your `weatherDest.js` to confirm that it still works as expected

* Now delete your `node_modules` folder again but keep your `packages.json` file. This time...

  * Simply run `npm install` or `npm i`

  * Confirm that you once again have a `node_modules` folder with your packages listed as dependencies

  * Finally, re-run `weatherDest.js` to confirm that it still works as expected
