# Inquirer Geocode

## File

* [`inquirerGeocode.js`](Unsolved/inquirerGeocode.js)

## Instructions

* Working in pairs, convert the geocoding code from earlier today so that it uses inquirer.js instead of `process.argv` to handle the intake of user inputs.

* Make sure your new code provides the exact same output as it did with `process.argv`.

### Hints

* Don't forget to run `npm install` to install the required npm packages.

* You should not need to change _that much_ code.

### Bonuses

* If you finish early, grab a TA's attention so that they can slack out the bonus activity (`29-ZombieChallenge`).
