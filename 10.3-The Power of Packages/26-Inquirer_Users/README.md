# Inquirer Users

## File

* [`userprompt.js`](Unsolved/userprompt.js)

## Instructions

* Create a basic command line Node application using the inquirer package.

* Your application should ask the user any five questions of your choosing.

* The question set should include at least one:

  * Basic input,
  * Password
  * List,
  * Checkbox,
  * Confirm

* Then if a user's password matches a pre-defined password, re-display the data back to the user with some text.

### Hints

* See the inquirer GitHub documentation "examples" page if you need help.

* Remember to get creative with your code!
