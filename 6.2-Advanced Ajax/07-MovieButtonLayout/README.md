# Movie Button Layout

## File

* [`movie-button-layout-easier`](Unsolved/movie-button-layout-easier.html) or [`movie-button-layout-harder`](Unsolved/movie-button-layout-harder.html)

## Instruction

* Using either `movie-button-layout-easier.html` or `movie-button-layout-harder.html` as a starting-point, replicate the functionality of the application just demonstrated to you.

* Your final code should:

  * Dynamically generate the initial buttons using jQuery

  * Allow users to create new buttons upon entering text in the textbox and clicking `Add a Movie Yo`.

  * If you finish early, begin reading about [HTML5 `data-*` attributes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Howto/Use_data_attributes) and how (and why) you would add them to dynamically generated elements with the [jQuery `.attr()` method](http://api.jquery.com/attr/).
