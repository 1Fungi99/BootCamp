# **Instructions**

* Now that we have learned how to import big collections of data into a server, it is time to put this new knowledge to the test by importing all of the data contained within `TopSongs.csv` into our database.

  * HINT: Remember, bigger datasets require more time to import properly, so be patient

  * HINT: If you feel that the import process is taking far too long, feel free to use `Top1000Songs.csv` instead. We would highly recommend working with the bigger dataset if you can, however.

  * HINT: Take the downtime you have been given to start on the next part of the activity

* With all of your data successfully imported into the database, begin working on a Node console application which will allow you to collect more specialized pieces of data. For example...

  * A query which returns all data for songs sung by a specific artist
  * A query which returns all artists who appear within the top 5000 more than once
  * A query which returns all data contained within a specific range
  * A query which searches for a specific song in the top 5000 and returns the data for it

* HINT: There are some MySQL queries which could make some of these tasks even easier to accomplish. Feel free to look at MySQL's documentation to find some of them.
