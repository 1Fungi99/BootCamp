# Friends List Refactor

In this activity we will use our new React skills to further refactor the Friends List application from earlier.

## Instructions

* Replace your React App's `src` folder with [Unsolved/src](Unsolved/src). Stop the dev server if it is already running. Start the app in dev mode by running `npm start`.

* Open [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser and take a moment to study the rendered app.

* Attempt to complete each of the following:
  
  1. Refactor the `App` component so that it's a class component. Set the component's initial state to the `friends` JSON array. Inside of the `render` method, map over `this.state.friends` to render each `FriendCard` component.

  2. Refactor the `App` component so that rather than rendering each `FriendCard` component manually, use a map to render one `FriendCard` component for each object in the `friends` JSON, passing in the appropriate props.

  3. Add functionality to the application so that when the red X icon on a `FriendCard` is clicked, that `FriendCard` is removed from the page. To accomplish this, you should define a method inside of `App` which accepts an `id` parameter, and then utilize filter to create a new array of friends without the passed `id`. Then set `this.state.friends` to this new filtered array. You'll want to pass this method into each `FriendCard` component and attach an `onClick` listener to the "remove" span.

## Hints

* Test your application after each step!!

* Refer back to the previous in class activities for if you get stuck anywhere.

* If you get stuck working with the event handler, spend a few minutes reading [React's Documentation](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/handling-events.html) on handling events.
