# AJAX Books

In this activity we will add functionality to a full stack React application for retrieving books from a database.

## Instructions

* Open the [Unsolved](Unsolved) folder in your editor and run `npm install` at the project's root.

* This application uses a Mongo database, so be sure to start `mongod`.

* In order to initially populate the database, run the following command at the project root: `npm run seed`.

* This should insert a few records into the MongoDB.

* Run `npm start` at the project root to start the application.

* Open your browser to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and take a moment to study the rendered application.

  * This example is a reading list application. Currently the app isn't fully functional.

* Open up `client/src/pages/Books.js` and add code so that when the component mounts, it performs an AJAX request to retrieve all of the books in the database. Once the AJAX request is complete, it should set `this.state.books` equal to the array of books.

* If successful, a list of books should be rendered on the right side of the page.

  * We'll work on making the form functional in the next activity.

## Hints

* Use the API helper module (`client/src/utils/API.js`) to perform an AJAX request which should return _all_ of the books in the database.

* The only file you will need to modify is `client/src/pages/Books.js`.
