# Truthy Falsey

In this activity we will refactor if/else statements to make use of short-circuit evaluation and ternary expressions.

## Instructions

* Open [Unsolved](Unsolved/index.js) in your code editor and read the comments for both examples.

  * Example 1 asks you to replace the conditional statement in `logMessage` with a short-circuit evaluation to set the default value of `message` to "Hello World!".

  * Example 2 asks that you use a ternary expression to set `message` to depending on the value of `beenWorkingAllDay`.

* **After completion, both of these functions should work the same way.**
