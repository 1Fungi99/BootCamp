# MongoJS and the Front End

## Instructions

1. Make a reusable function for creating a table body in index.html with the results from your MongoDB query. Each row should have info for one animal.

2. Make two AJAX functions that fire when users click the two buttons on index.html.
    
   * When the user clicks the Weight button, the table should display the animal data sorted by weight.
   
   * When the user clicks the Name button, the table should display the animal data sorted by name.

* Good luck!

### Hints

* We don't want to keep adding to the table with each button click. We only want to show the new results.
What can we do to the table to accomplish this?
