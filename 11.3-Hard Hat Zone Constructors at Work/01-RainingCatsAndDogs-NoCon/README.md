# **Instructions**

* Make a dogs object with three keys...

  * First key called "raining" with a value of true

* Second key called "noise" with a value of "Woof!"

* Third key called "makeNoise" which contains a function which console.logs the noise to the screen if it is raining dogs

* Make a cats object with three keys...

  * First key called "raining" with a value of false

  * Second key called "noise" with a value of "Meow!"

  * Third key called "makeNoise" which contains a function which console.logs the noise to the screen if it is raining cats

* Make the dog bark

* Make the cat meow

* BONUS: Create a function called "massHysteria" which takes in both the cats and the dogs object and prints "DOGS AND CATS LIVING TOGETHER! MASS HYSTERIA!" if both of the `raining` keys are equal to true.

* BONUS: Look to see if you can find any means to simplify your code further and further
