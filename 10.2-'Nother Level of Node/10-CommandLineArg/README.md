# Command Line Arg

## File

* *None*

## Instructions

* Starting from a blank JavaScript file, create a Node application that takes in two command line arguments and checks if they are equal. If the two numbers are equal then output: "true". Otherwise output: "false".

### Hints

* `console.log(process.argv)` as a starting point if you are completely lost.

### Bonuses

* Check if the two numbers are both multiples of 7. Again output "true" if they are and output "false" if they are not.
