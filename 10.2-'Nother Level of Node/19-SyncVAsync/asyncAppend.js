// This file is written in this funny way so you can better visualize how Node's asynchronous pattern works.
// Because Node is asynchronous, code will run seemingly out of order.
// Pay attention to how the variable "secondNumber" gets printed.
// It doesn't wait for the append to complete. It runs immediately.
// This is purposeful. If you aren't careful, this will trip you up. Be mindful of the async nature!

  var secondNumber = 0;
  // Inside of the readFile callback, we use the appendFile function
  // The first parameter is the name of the text file to save to
  // The second parameter is the data we want to write as a string
  // The third parameter is the callback function to be called when appendFile is finished
