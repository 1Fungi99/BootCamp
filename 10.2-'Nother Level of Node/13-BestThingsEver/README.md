# Best Things Ever

## File

* [`best_things_ever.txt`](Unsolved/best_things_ever.txt)

## Instructions

* Create a Node application that reads the `best_things_ever.txt` file, parses the comma separated elements, and ultimately console logs each element in the file on separate lines.

* Your final output should look something like this:

  ```
  lazy boy recliner
    massage
    meditation
    hot shower
    cheese fondue
    hot coffee with cashew milk
    kitten falling asleep on my lap
  ```

### Hints

* If you are struggling to figure out how to loop your way through the text, look into the `.split()` method. This could make your life a whole lot easier.
