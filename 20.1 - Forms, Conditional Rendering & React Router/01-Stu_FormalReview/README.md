# A Formal Review

In this activity we will review using forms with React

## Instructions

* Replace your React application's src folder with [Unsolved/src](Unsolved/src)

* Start the application in dev mode by running `npm start` in your terminal.

* Open your browser to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and study the rendered application.

* Update this application to accomplish the following:

  * When the user types into the input fields, the values should be captured to the component’s state.
  
  * When the form is submitted, throw an alert for the user displaying their chosen username and password values. Then clear the input fields.

### Hints

* Check out the [React documentation on Forms](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/forms.html)
