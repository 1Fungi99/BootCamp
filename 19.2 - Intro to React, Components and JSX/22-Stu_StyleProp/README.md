# Style Prop

In this activity we will explore some built-in options for styling React components.

## Instructions

* Replace your React application's `src` folder with [Unsolved/src](Unsolved/src). Stop the dev server if it is already running. Start the app in dev mode by running `npm start`.

* Open [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your web browser and take a moment to study the rendered application.

  ![Initial Page](Images/01-InitialPage.png)

* This application consists of three main components:

  * `Header`

  * `Navbar`

  * `Section`

* Each component is styled using imported external stylesheets.

* Using only inline styles, and without altering any of the CSS files, update each component so the rendered page looks like this:
