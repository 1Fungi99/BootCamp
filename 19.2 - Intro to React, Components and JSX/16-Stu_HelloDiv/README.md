# Hello Div

In this activity, we will render a list of JSX elements inside of a div.

## Instructions

* Replace the `src` folder of your React app with [src](Unsolved/src). Stop the dev server if it is already running. Start the app in dev mode by running `npm start`.

* Using the code in the [HelloDiv.js](Unsolved/src/components/HelloDiv.js) file as a starting point, update the `HelloDiv` function so that it returns the following JSX:

  * A heading tag introducing yourself, e.g., `<h1>Hello! My name is <insert name here></h1>`.

  * An unordered list containing at least 3 things you like (these can be anything).

### Hints

* You will need to import the React library.

* Reference the previous `HelloReact` activity if you get stuck with any syntax.

* If you're trying to render multiple JSX tags from a single component, you should enclose all of the JSX tags within a single parent tag, such as a `div`.
