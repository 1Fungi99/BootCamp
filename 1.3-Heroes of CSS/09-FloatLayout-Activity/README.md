# Don't be a floater

* Introduce yourself to 1â€“2 people next to you.

* Then using `floats.html` and `floats.css` as a starting point, work together to create the missing CSS necessary to form the layout shown to you on screen. 

* This will not be easy so work at it as best you can. This is a challenging activity. At the very least, try to increase your understanding of CSS properties.

* Hint: Concentrate on first figuring out how to create the boxes. Think about using background colors (CSS property: `background`). 

* Hint: We've provided the styling you need for the header element. Use this as a starting point to style the others. 

* Hint: You will need to apply each of the following CSS properties at least once:

  * padding

  * margin

  * background

  * float

  * width (read up on width by percents)

  * color

  * clear

  * overflow

  * height

  * font-size

  * line-height

* If you finish early Slack the TAs or raise your hand to call their attention. TAs will reassign you to help others in the class.
