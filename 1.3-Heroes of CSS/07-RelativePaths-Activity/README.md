# Instructions

* Unzip the folder provided to you (or copy and paste the contents outside).

* Then modify each of the four `html-bio.html` pages such that they can access the CSS inside their folder. Don't move the CSS file, and don't move the HTML file. 

* Use relative linking to make it work!

* Hint: If you need some reading material on relative linking you can use <https://css-tricks.com/quick-reminder-about-file-paths/>.

* If you finish early, help out those around you, or begin reading through the Learn CSS Layout Guide found here: <http://learnlayout.com/no-layout.html>
