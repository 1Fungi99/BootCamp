# AJAX to HTML

## File

* [`ajax-to-html`](Unsolved/ajax-to-html.html)

## Instructions

* Using the starter code in [`ajax-to-html`](Unsolved/ajax-to-html.html), create and append a new table row to the existing table body. The new row should display the retrieved movie's `Title`, `Year`, and `Actors`.

* Once you have successfully created and populated a new table row, repeat this process to query the OMDB API for two more movies of your choice! Append two more rows containing the results from both AJAX requests.

### Hints

* You will have to build a URL of your own with the search parameters listed.

### Bonus

* Once you've completed the basic activity, refactor your solution to be more DRY by placing repetitive logic inside of functions to be called when needed.
