## File

* [`1-student-do-todolist`](../01-todolist-nopersistence/Unsolved/1-student-do-todolist.html)

## Instructions

* Using a working example of the to-do application `1-student-do-todolist-solution.html` incorporate the use of `localStorage` to create data persistence.

* Have the group member who hasn't typed yet become the typist in the group while the other two take on the role of supervisor.

* **HINT:** You will need to create an additional array of todos that you can keep adding todo items to.

* **HINT:** You will need to selectively delete array elements to get this working properly. (Suggestion: Look into `.splice`)

* **HINT:** You will need to take an array and dump the contents into localStorage (Suggestion: Use `JSON.stringify(todoArray)`).

* **HINT:** Don't freak out. This is hard, but push yourselves as best you can!
