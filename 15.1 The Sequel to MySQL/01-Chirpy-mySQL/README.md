* INSTRUCTIONS:

  * Using the app skeleton provided to you:
    * Create a MySQL database named `'chirpy'` with a `'chirps'` table to hold your data.
    * Your `'chirp'` table should include a field for id, author, chirp, and time created.
    * Modify the connection.js file to create a connection to your database.
    * Modify the api-routes.js file so that there is a route for adding a new chirp, as well as retrieving all chirps.
    * Modify the chirps.js file so that the page interacts with the database.
