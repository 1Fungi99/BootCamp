# Eslint Example

In this example we will use eslint to fix issues with the calculator app from the previous activity.

## Instructions

* Install the [VS Code Eslint Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint).

* Open the [Unsolved](Unsolved) folder and run `npm install` from your terminal to install dependencies.

* Now open [Unsolved/example.js](Unsolved/example.js) in your code editor. If you were able to complete the previous steps correctly, you should see red annotations under different parts of the code. Hovering over each displays a popover with an eslint rule being broken.

* Work to fix each part of the annotated code. 

### Bonus

* Try changing the quote style to enforce single-quotes instead of double-quotes.

### Hints

* If you're unsure about what an eslint rule is asking for, type it into Google for examples.
