# No Lint Example

In this activity we will examine and identify issues with existing JavaScript code without the help of any linting tools.

## Instructions

* Before looking at any code, open [Unsolved/index.html](Unsolved/index.html) in your web browser and study the rendered application.

  * This simple example prompts the user for 2 numbers, and then what sort of mathematical operation they would like to perform. The result is then alerted back to the user.

* Now open [Unsolved/example.js](Unsolved/example.js) in your editor.

  * For what this application is supposed to do, the code works perfectly.

* Discuss with your partner: Even though the code works, what's wrong with it?
