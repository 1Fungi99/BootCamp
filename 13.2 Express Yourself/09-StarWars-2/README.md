# Star Wars 02

## File

* `server2.js`

## Instructions

* Examine the code sent to you. Once again, run the `server2.js` file and view the page in the browser. Troubleshoot any issues that arise. Again NO CODE CHANGES required.

  * Then once you have a working server instance, begin to examine the file. Try to explain to yourself and those around you what the significance of `/:character` and `req.params.character` is.

  * Create a test case to check your hypothesis.
