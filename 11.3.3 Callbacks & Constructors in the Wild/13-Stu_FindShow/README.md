# Find Show

In this activity we will be adding functionality to search the TV Maze API to find a show passed in as a command line argument.

## Instructions

* Open the `tv.js` file. This file contains a constructor function that will be used to create a TV object capable of searching the TV Maze API for shows and actors. 

* Install the `axios` package by running `npm install axios` in your terminal. We will use the `axios` module to make HTTP requests to the TV Maze API. Require the `axios` package and the built-in `fs` package at the top of the `tv.js` file.

* Inside of the `TV` constructor function's `findShow` method, use the `axios` package to hit the TV Maze API for the `URL` string. 

* Once you have the response body of the HTTP request, store the response.data into a variable.

* After getting the JSON response from the HTTP request, create a string containing the following information from the returned show data:

  * The name of the show
  * The show's genre(s)
  * The show's average rating
  * The show's network name
  * The show's summary

* Save this string to the `log.txt` file using the `fs.appendFile` method. If the file does not already exist, `fs.appendFile` will create it.

* After saving the data to the `log.txt` file, print this information to the console.

* Verify your code works by running the cli file and passing in the name of a TV show, e.g. `node cli show Scrubs`. This should print the specified information to the console and save it to the `log.txt` file.

### Hints

* Check out some sample output from the TV Maze single show search API: <http://api.tvmaze.com/singlesearch/shows?q=scrubs>.

* You would have used the `axios` package for the Liri HW assignment. Refer back to this if you need a refresher on how to use the package.
