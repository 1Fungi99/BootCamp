# Architecture

In this activity we will sketch/psuedo-code out the high level architecture of the TV app.

## Instructions

* As a best practice, sketch out the architecture of your application _before_ you start writing code.

* For this exercise, start by describing what your application does. Do this in a bullet list.

* Next, decide how you might divvy up these responsibilities. Would you write a single module that handles all of them? Would you write one module for each bullet list? Something else? Be sure to justify your decision.

* Finally, draw a diagram describing the flow of your application. Don't worry about being _too_ precise here, but include enough detail where you can use it as a guide to explain it to someone else. You can do this either by using pencil and paper or flowchart generation software like [draw.io](https://www.draw.io/).

* Take a moment to study the GIF below if stuck. Remember that this application also prints the logged data to a file named `log.txt`.
