# **Instructions**

* Write a function that accepts a string and a function as arguments. It should log the string, and then run the function.

* Write a function that accepts a boolean value and a function as arguments. It should run the function if and only if the boolean argument is true.

* Write a function that accepts a function(F) and a value (V), and returns a function that returns the result of running F on V. This sounds tricky, but it's easier than it soundsâ€”just take it step by step!

* Finally, write a short message to a file using `fs.writeFile`. Does this function use callbacks? If so, identify them.
